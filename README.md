# yarnes (Y-r's R-venge for the NES)

Porting (well, re-implementing) a certain 2600 game to the NES. Uses no original code. Targets the [NROM mapper](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NROM), AKA no mapper at all.

## Requirements
Uses ca65/ld65 from the [cc65](https://github.com/cc65/cc65) package to build.

## To whoever owns the rights
I'm doing this strictly because I love the game, and I want to learn NES development without having to invent a game at the same time. I'll never try to sell this. Please don't hurt me.
